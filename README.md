# Group-07

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## First time setup

1. [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Install JupyterLab with pip by running: `pip install jupyterlab`
1. Clone this repository locally: `git clone https://github.coventry.ac.uk/380CT-2021/Group-07.git`
1. Open terminal in the cloned directory
1. Install required Python packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Start JupyterLab by running: `jupyter-lab`

## Getting started with Jupyter

There is a [Getting Starter](/Getting-Started) directory which contains example Jupyter Notebooks:
- [working_with_notebooks.ipynb](/Getting-Started/working_with_notebooks.ipynb) An introduction to the Jupyter interface and kernels
- [plotting_data.ipynb](/Getting-Started/plotting_data.ipynb) A comprehensive guide for plotting 2D and 3D data using matplotlib

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation system that enables the writing of scientific formulas inside markdown.

The following links can be used as a cheat-sheet for writing LaTeX:
- Basics: http://www.malinc.se/math/latex/basiccodeen.php
- Greek letters and math symbols: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols
- Comprehensive list of mathematical symbols: https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols

## Dependencies

All Python dependencies that are used in this project should be added to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file on a new line. This allows them all to be installed with a single command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
