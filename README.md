# Applied Metaheuristics

In this work, we look at generating improved solutions to the 'Travelling Salesman Problem' using metaheuristics. In particular **Ant Colonony Optimisation** and a variant of the **Genetic Algorithm** are used. We initally compare the two metaheuristics against a greedy nearest neighbour algorithm and then against one another.

## First time setup

1. [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Install JupyterLab with pip by running: `pip install jupyterlab`
1. Clone this repository locally
1. Open terminal in the cloned directory
1. Install required Python packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Start JupyterLab by running: `jupyter-lab`

## Dependencies

All Python dependencies that are used in this project should be added to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file on a new line. This allows them all to be installed with a single command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
